# Customer Segmentation of a Photo Company

## 1.	Introduction

All customers have diverse needs and desires and respond to marketing campaigns in different ways. Mass marketing strategies might improve the sales, but it would be a better approach to do the homework and analyze the customers based on their purchase behavior. As the business grows, segmenting customers can significantly improve marketing performance, making campaigns more relevant to more of the customers, ultimately increasing response rates and sales. A Photo Company provided its data and wanted to gain more information on customer behavior. To boost the sales and excel in the service it provides, the company wants to target each segment separately in its marketing campaigns. My goal is to group customers into segments to understand high level trends better by providing insights on metrics across product/service and customer lifecycle.


## 2.	Process

First, I performed a cohort analysis and calculated customer retention rates through the year of 2016. Next, I analyzed RFMT (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value and Tenure) values. Finally, I used K-Means Clustering, and employed Snake Plots, Relative Importance of Segment Attributes Heatmap and Silhouette Analysis to identify, verify and visualize the clusters. 

## 3.	Results

All methods clearly identified two clusters in the data.  While favoring 2 clusters, a 3 clusters option was also possible in all methods. 	Through RFMT Analysis, I was able to perform a fair segmentation into 3 almost equally distanced clusters in terms of RFMT and size of each clusters. For better capturing customer behavior and more focused marketing to target diverse customers, I suggested using a 3-clustered customer segmentation pending managerial decision.
